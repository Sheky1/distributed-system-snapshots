# Distributed System Snapshots

A system that takes snapshots of a distributed system state where each node has an amount of "bit-cakes", and are constantly exchanging them. The project was done for an university course "Concurrent and Distributed Systems".

The test folder with it's files is chosen inside the MultipleServentStarter class. In order to change the way a system behaves, a new test configuration is needed.
